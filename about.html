			<p><img src="images/eric.jpg" class="eric">Hello! Here is a <em>small</em> portion on what I've done over the past couple of years. First off, my name is Eric, I'm 23 years old that has recently finished school about two years ago. I've studied three different courses and here are what they are: <b>Game Development</b>; what we did most of the time was coding with C++ as well as draw a lot of sketches of  Although it had a lot of things in this career I decided it wasn't what I wanted to do. I decided to try a year of <b>pre-animation</b> where we sketches a lot characters, bodies and body positions, we then rendered them and designed their appearence and their movement. I wanted to get more into coding because I enjoyed coding in generale. That's why I tried a year of <b>E-publishing</b> and we did a lot of coding regarding PHP, HTML and coding. As well as designing small websites. After 4 years at school I am now full time at company named Events Online which provides custom registration, as well as I do side jobs to expand my knowledge and give others sites that they can use on a daily basis. With Events Online I handle the custom needs a client would require (forms, reports, custom dashboards, styling and etc...). Each registration has a life-span that can bring in millions of dollars, but we do a lot of charity work as well for the Ottawa Army Run.
